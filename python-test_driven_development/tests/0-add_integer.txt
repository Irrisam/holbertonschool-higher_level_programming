# Test Cases for add_integer

# Test Case 1
# Description: Testing addition of two positive integers
# Input: 1, 2
# Expected Output: 3
# Reason: The sum of 1 and 2 is 3.
Expected Output: 3
assert add_integer(1, 2) == 3

# Test Case 2
# Description: Testing addition of a positive integer and a negative integer
# Input: 100, -2
# Expected Output: 98
# Reason: The sum of 100 and -2 is 98.
assert add_integer(100, -2) == 98

# Test Case 3
# Description: Testing addition of one positive integer (default value of the second integer is 0)
# Input: 2
# Expected Output: 2
# Reason: The sum of 2 and 0 is 2.
assert add_integer(2) == 2

# Test Case 4
# Description: Testing addition of a float and a negative integer
# Input: 100.3, -2
# Expected Output: 98
# Reason: The sum of 100.3 and -2 is 98 (the float value is converted to an integer).
assert add_integer(100.3, -2) == 98

# Test Case 5
# Description: Testing addition of an integer and a string
# Input: 4, "School"
# Expected Output: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
# Reason: The addition operation is not supported between an integer and a string.
try:
    add_integer(4, "School")
except TypeError as e:
    assert str(e) == "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'"

# Test Case 6
# Description: Testing addition with None as an argument
# Input: None
# Expected Output: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'
# Reason: The addition operation is not supported between an integer and None.
try:
    add_integer(None)
except TypeError as e:
    assert str(e) == "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'"
